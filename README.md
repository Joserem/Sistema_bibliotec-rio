## About this Project 

"Implement a library management system to make it easier to
consultations/loans of available copies"

# Functionalities 

The system's functionalities are: consultation/availability, loan,
return, book status, inclusion/removal by librarians, etc.

The system also has specific features for each user,
such as:

• Students can keep the book for 5 days, teachers for 10;

• Students pay a fine if they don't return the book on the specified date, teachers
no;

• Students can borrow up to 3 copies, teachers can borrow up to 6 copies.
is 6;

• Librarians can add new books to the library catalog. Each book
has characteristics such as title, author, ISBN and an indication of its availability.

# Why?

This project is a significant part of my personal portfolio and was also developed as part of an academic assignment. 
The challenge was to solve a practical problem: to simplify the process of consulting and borrowing copies.
Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my ability to apply theoretical concepts to solve real-world problems.

## Some observations about this App

1- The app doesn't save information (once the app is closed all the information in it disappears), a database or a saving function could be added.

2 - For it to work properly, the program must be started from the login screen.
