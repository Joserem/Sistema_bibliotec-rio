- **Loans and returns** with specific rules for students and teachers.
- ⚠️ **Automatic fines** for late returns (for students only).
- **Registration and removal of books** by librarians.
- **Availability control** for each copy.

## 🛠 Technologies used
- Python
- **Tkinter** (graphical interface)
